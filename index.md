>  Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in computational chemistry, molecular dynamics, protein-ligand interactions and drug discovery

Skills
----------------
I use python libraries to study the interactions between molecules and proteins. This includes custom data visualization of large datasets,
non-linear curve fitting with Bayesian estimation, clustering in high dimensions, predicting new drugs with new structures, and cost-benefit analyses
to bring drug discovery to academics. 

For examples see:

- molecular dynamics simulations of ligands bound to the active site of proteins ([cannabinoid1_scra](https://github.com/ljmartin/cannabinoid1_scra))
- validating the best way to describe ligands to predict their activity with machine learning ([molecular_fingerprints](https://github.com/ljmartin/fp_low_ave))
- comparing frequentist and Bayesian confidence intervals ([timeseries_CI](https://ljmartin.github.io/technical-notes/stats/estimators-autocorrelated/))
